# Cryptocoin library - for educational purposes

Writing a blockchain system from scratch, NOT MEANT FOR PRODUCTION USE!!!

## Modules so far
* **hashing**: manual (and simple) implementation of the SHA-256 hashing algorithm
* **blockchain**: manual implementation of a simple blockchain system, with proof of work validation (WIP)
* **digital signature**: manual implementation of the Elliptical Curve Cryptography based digital signature algorithm.

## Planned modules
* coin
* weak hashing method (for demonstration)

## TODO/Extensions:
* Block: make hashing method choosable
